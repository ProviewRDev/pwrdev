pwrtest02 is a test project for the development package.
It contains scripts to create and configure a project, and a 
number of test programs.

The cpp test programs has to be built with a development tree, thus the
project is generated here and the testprograms built. The test programs
are gathered in $pwrp_load/pwrtest02.tar.gz.

For manual build:

pwre commands to build and clean the project
> pwre module project
> pwre build pwrtest02 build src
> pwre build pwrtest02 build src clean


build_from_git.sh will configure and build the project and build the
test programs.

For manual handling and running the project environment it set up by
test02_setup.sh

When the project is built, the test programs will generate log-files on
$pwrp_log. They can be examined by test_xtt, eg 

test_xtt -f $pwrp_log/\*.tlog
